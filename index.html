          <span>A long time ago...</span>
          In the 1970's, the film industry was dominated by movies that reflected
          the views of a cynical American people. The Vietnam War had left a sour
          taste, Nixon had left the populous questioning their leadership, and
          on top of that gas prices were up. Downbeat films with anti-heroes and
          questionable morals dominated the cinema, and in the midst of all the
          negativity, a fantastical coming of age story about a farmer, his wise old
          mentor, a scoundrel, and a princess broke onto the big screen and into
          people's hearts. Star Wars, a film that had struggled against all odds to
          get made, became an overnight sensation in the summer of 1977.

          On top of being a classically fantastical film set in space, Star Wars
          won several Academy Awards for its unprecedented achievements and
          innovations in the film industry.

          In 1989, the National Film Registry was opened as a section of the Library
          of Congress with the mission of preserving twenty-five culturally
          significant films every year for future generations. Star Wars (1977) was
          chosen as one of the first twenty-five films. However, to this day, the
          National Film Registry has yet to receive the copy of Star Wars that it
          asked for. Instead, LucasFilms sent a "Special Edition" copy of the film,
          that made arguably small but significant changes to the historical
          weight of the film. George Lucas and his former company simply refuse to
          release the theatrical release of the film, to either the National Film
          Registry, or the public.

          The re-released "Special Edition" that was sent to the National Film
          Registry and is circulated around the public has admittedly brushed up
          the film in certain respects. It has been cleaned up in high definition,
          with clearer colors and sounds. However, there are numerous needless
          changes that detract from the original film, and oftentimes take away
          many of the aspects that had made the film culturally significant and
          win its Academy Awards. From changing original aliens into already-dated
          computer generated ones to revising certain shots, the "Special Edition"
          tampers with the magic of Star Wars.

          Much of the award-winning costume design has been replaced by computer-
          generated aliens. Not only do these aliens already look dated by modern
          standards, they also look out of place in this film from 1977 and
          overwrite one of the aspects that had won the film an Academy Award.

          In the famous case of "Han Shot First!" a few frames were added in that

          The original visual effects in Star Wars were unprecedented and had paved
          a whole new path within the industry for story-telling. However, like many
          other award-winning aspects of the theatrical release, this one was replaced
          in many places by computer generated effects in the "Special Edition."

          George Lucas made a bold and historical move in 1977 by re-establishing
          classical music into cinema. John Williams' sweeping score can be
          remembered on the spot by millions of people worldwide. Yet, once again,
          in Lucas' continuing frenzy to tinker with his movie, he drowns out
          Williams' scores with new sound effects in certain parts of the movie,
          further corroding the original masterpiece.

          <em>“</em><span>To me, the Special Edition ones are the films I wanted to make,
          Anybody that makes films knows the film is never finished. It’s abandoned

          George Lucas claims the "Special Edition" is simply how he would have done
          Star Wars if the technology was there at the time.
          Although Lucas has a point here, the question becomes whether Star Wars,
          a landmark of American cinema and worldwide phenomenon, still belongs to
          him and his company, or to the people that adore it, and whether he has
          the right to continuously tinker with and re-release an adored film.

          Anyone that has worked on any assignment feels it could continue to be
          improved upon, however, in the case of Star Wars, the original theatrical
          release was historical, and its preservation is key to both American
          cinema's history and culture, and to its loyal fans. A long time ago,
          George Lucas may have agreed with this point as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          By changing the film, George Lucas is tampering with history itself.
          Personally, I did not even know that editions had been made to the
          movie the first time I watched it. If someone mentioned the historical
          significance of the effects, I naturally assumed the effects that were
          mentioned were the ones I had seen in the movie. Little did I know that
          so many of the historical, award-winning aspects of the original movie
          had been changed before I had seen it. This is a problem when entire
          generations of viewers do not know what was in the original film
          and what was not, and therefore cannot connect with the past and the
          historical and cultural significance of the film. For all these reasons
          and more, LucasFilm should release the original theatrical release of the
          film to both the National Film Registry and the public, so that this
          landmark in cinematic history may be preserved for future generations
          to come.
